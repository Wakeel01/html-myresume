<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am an optimistic and enthusiastic sales professional with over 10 years experience
    in the industry. Having studied IT, I applied my knowledge within various fields and
    quickly found my talent in Sales. Having in-depth knowledge of my customers needs
    and what technology is available today allowed me to exceed customer
    expectations and provide excellent service. I am passionate about people as well as
    developing and maintaining strong relationships. I attribute this to my strong ability
    to listening and putting the needs of customers first. Now with my new Journey in becoming

    any website, what makes things more user friendly and how to optomize and generate better business.
